        <h2>How to cook!</h2>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Boil the noodles: Cook the Fettuccine al dente, according to package instructions</li>
            <br>
            <li>Cook the chicken: Season the chicken, then pan-fry in oil and butter, for 6 minutes a side, or until an internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for a few minutes, then cut into 1/2-inch thick slices. Tent with foil, while you prepare the sauce.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Make the Alfredo sauce: Using the same pan you used to cook the chicken, the cream, butter and seasonings are incorporated and simmered on medium-low heat until thickened then the Parmesean is added in until melted and smooth.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Assemble: Drain the pasta, reserving some of the liquid to loosen the sauce (only if necessary.) Toss immediately with the Alfredo sauce. Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of cooked chicken. Garnsih with parsley, more Parmesean, and black pepper if desired.</li>
